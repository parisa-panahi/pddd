# Pythonic Domain Driven Design
This project is inspired by Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal  (Ports & 
Adapters) architecture, Onion Architecture, Clean Architecture, and Explicit 
Architecture. It provides a set of toolkits that help you build your 
architecture based on any of these architectures or a combination of those. So 
it's not supposed to be a framework, guideline, boilerplate, example, or 
anything like that.

Some classes and functions help you implement patterns like Command and Query 
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD), and 
Dependency Injection.

These toolkits are designed to be easily used by other architecture like 
Event-driven architecture (EDA), Event Sourcing (ES), Microservices 
architecture, and even MVC architecture.
